### Continued development

This was our first project with burguer menu, we only used sass and js to develop it. wewere able to manipulate the elements to make the dropdowns, and we felt comfortable doing the project. This week we managed to improve our skills a lot by manipulating the DOM with js(https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp), we are  very happy with the result and our performance!
